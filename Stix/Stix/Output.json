  "Impact": "The attack began on 29 January and is affecting 13 fuel terminals in Germany. The incident has seen the automated systems used for filling tank knocked offline, meaning facility workers are having to do the job manually.

  "Summary": "The most recent maritime incident in this dabatase involving some form of ransomware started in Germany on the 29th of January in 2022. The two companies that were hit by the attack were Mabanaft GmbH and the Oil tanking GmbH Group, which share a parent company. The cyber criminals operated with a ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) business model. The attackers were a group of Russians who previously referred to themselves as ‘’The Darkside Group’’ and therefore ‘’Blackmatter’’. Now the group is called the ‘’Black Cat’’ and they move around networks very quickly. Because of the actions of these cyber criminals, part of Germany's fuel delivery system was knocked out for a few days, and payments at certain filling stations were halted. It was clear that the aim of the attack was financial gain, but the amount of money that was requested by the group is . For most of its inland supply activity in Germany, Mabanaft has declared force majeure. Around 233 petrol stations were disturbed, most of them in northern Germany. They had to reroute to various supply depots because of the attack. No Oil Tanking operations outside of Germany were harmed. A consequence of this was that facility workers are having to do the job manually. The company immediately took steps to improve the security of the systems and processes. They initiated an investigation towards the incident with the help of experts. They’re also working closely with the appropriate authorities. In a company statement they said that they tried to resolve the issue in accordance with the contingency procedures, as well as to fully comprehend the incident's scale. ",

Those waterways are considered Russian territory by the Kremlin, but they belong to Ukraine for much of the rest of the world. To discourage the Royal Navy vessel, Russia's Defense Ministry claimed it fired warning shots and dropped missiles. The Ministry of Defence of the United Kingdom refuted the assertions. The HMS Defender and a Dutch frigate, HNLMS Evertsen, were seen nearing the port of Sevastopol in Crimea in the early hours of June 19, 2021, according to the site's tracking data. Strangely enough, they were not present. Both ships were docked around 300 kilometers away in Odessa, Ukraine, when Marine Traffic showed them entering Russian-controlled territory, according to a live camera feed. The simulated trip was published on Marine Traffic as a warning by an anonymous person. It was all about provoking a reaction and \"deploying disruptive power\".",

  "Summary": "An interesting ransomware attack occurred on the 25th of November in 2021 at the trusted marine services provider (SPO). The IT systems were infected with a variant of the CLOP ransomware caused by the Russian group called CLOP Gang. The group has claimed credit for the cyberattack and has released screenshots of the stolen data. They used the CLOP ransomware, which is a virus that bypasses protection to encrypt files that aren't protected. ‘’It is part of the well-known Crypto mix ransomware family, which is a harmful file-encrypting virus that intentionally avoids security-vulnerable systems and encrypts stored data by planting the CLOP extension’'. The stolen data included full names, company name, locations, phone numbers, email addresses, bank details, and passport scans. Employees in Singapore and Malaysia appear to be the most impacted, however some records belong to employees in China, the Philippines, and the United Kingdom. The total number of people who were exposed is 2,500, which corresponds to the company's seafaring and onshore workforce in 18 countries. The incident had no significant impact on SPO's global operations. It remains not exactly clear what the purpose of this attack was. The provider has taken quick efforts to strengthen current security measures and limit the incident's potential effect. SPO is also collaborating with data security specialists to investigate the attack and identify what additional actions may be required, and it will take all necessary efforts to secure its customers and employees now and in the future.",

Russia's intelligence bureau FSB said the group had \"ceased to exist (Januari 2022)\". However, it does not appear that any Russian members of the gang will be extradited to the United States. In a joint operation, police and FSB searched 25 addresses, detained 14 people, and seized 426 million roubles ($4 million), $600,000, 500,000 euros, computer equipment, and 20 luxury cars.

  "Attack Pattern": "In an email sent on the 27th and seen by researchers, the hacker requested the French carrier to contact it within two days “via live chat and pay for the special decryption key.”  The exact price was not shared outside the company. Ragnar Locker is a ransomware that affects devices running Microsoft Windows operating systems.  It was initially observed towards the end of December 2019 as part of a series of attacks against compromised networks.  This malware is deployed manually after an initial compromise, network reconnaissance and pre-deployed tasks on the network.  These tactics show this is a more complex operation than most ransomware propagation campaigns.   Before starting the Ragnar Locker ransomware, attackers inject a module capable of collecting sensitive data from infected machines and upload it to their servers.  Next, threat actors behind the malware notify the victim the files will be released to the public if the ransom is not paid. RagnarLocker ransomware is usually distributed via emailattachments and advertisers. Files of infected systems can no longer be accessed, extensions are changed and an automatic ransom message is being generated. The threat actor begin the attack by compromising the company’s network via RDP service, using brute force to guess weak passwords or with stolen credentials bought on the Dark Web. Next, the attacker performs second-stage reconnaissance. To elevate privileges, the attacker exploits the CVE-2017-0213 vulnerability in the Windows COM Aggregate Marshaler to run arbitrary code with elevated privileges. Having achieved privilege escalation, the attacker sometimes deploys a VirtualBox virtual machine (VM) with a Windows XP image to evade detection: an early use of a virtual machine image in this manner to run the ransomware encryption attack. The specially-crafted VM image is loaded to the VirtualBox VM, mapping all local drives as read\/writable into the virtual machine. This allows the ransomware process running inside the VM to encrypt all files. To the host files, the encryption appears to be a trusted VirtualBox process and thus will be ignored by many security products.\n \nNext, the Ragnar Locker operator deletes any extant shadow copies, disables any detected antivirus countermeasures, and uses a PowerShell script to move from one company network asset to another one. Finally, before launching Ragnar Locker ransomware, the attacker steals sensitive files and uploads them to one or more servers to publish them if the victim refuses to pay the ransom. The ransomware code is protected with obfuscation techniques that include adding junk code as well as encryption. The sample code snippet below shows such junk arithmetic instructions, the results of which are not used.",

  "Summary": "One of the most popular ransomware attacks is the one on the large French shipping company CMA CGM. This cyber incident occurred in the end of September 2020 (Port Technology International Team, 2021). During the ransomware attack in September 2020, the cybercriminals from a group named ‘’Ragnar Locker Gang’’ stole personal data from clients using the Ragnar Locker ransomware and demanded a ransom before giving the data back to the company. In an email sent on the 27th of September and seen by researchers, the hacker requested the French carrier to contact it within two days via live chat and pay for the special decryption key. It was clear that the aim of the attack was financial gain. The exact price was not shared outside the company. Besides that, the company stated that their marine and port activities were still working normally. To prevent the ransomware from spreading to the rest of the worldwide network, the corporation quickly disabled its internet connection. As a result, all online booking services and requests for operations were suspended. For bookings and queries, customers were directed to their nearest local office. Even though the ports and boats remained operational, loading processes were hampered to some extent. ",

  "Attack Pattern": "In this case, maritime infrastructures were not directly targeted, but were incidentally affected due to their interconnection with information systems in Aix-Marseille-Provence, which was the main target of the attack. Pysa takes an approach commonly referred to as “big game hunting,” meaning that the ransomware group targets high-value assets in organizations that are particularly sensitive to data loss or system downtime. PYSA is a human-operated ransomware that does not have self-propagation capabilities. Threat actors manually deploy the PYSA ransomware as part of full attack operations. The PYSA ransomware operators typically gain initial access to target systems by compromising credentials or through phishing emails. Prior to the deployment of the ransomware, the malicious actors use publicly available and\/or open-source tools for credential theft, stealthiness, privilege escalation, lateral movement, and more. It’s typically distributed via brute-force attacks on servers in which RDP or AD is exposed to the internet. Attackers then exfiltrate the organization’s credentials database. PowerShell and Batch scripts attempt to stop — or even uninstall — antivirus solutions. Once executed, Pysa performs the following actions:\n\nCreates a mutex named “Pysa” to check whether another instance of Pysa ransomware has already run. If the “Pysa” mutex already exists, the malware finishes its execution without encrypting. This prevents double encryption of the user’s files. Then, the virus creates two threads for encryption. The virus uses a persistence technique — adding a reference to the system registry — to open the ransom note every time the system boots up and deletes its executables by dropping a .bat file. Files and folders that aren’t specified on either list are automatically added to the blacklist and marked for encryption.\n \nAfter generating the unique key and IV, Pysa divides up files and directories for encryption according to the allowlist and denylist hardcoded in the ransomware body. The allowlist includes vital directories, such as Windows and Boot, as encrypting these would make recovery via the attackers’ decryptor impossible. Also included are any files with the .README, .exe, .dll, .search-ms, .sys, and .pysa extensions.\nEncrypted files are appended with the .pysa extension. Finally, Pysa drops the ransom note in every directory, except for those on the allowlist.",

  "Attack Pattern": "Hackers stole over 300 GB of company's data, then asked to pay ransom for a data encryptor in order to access data. Hackers then leaked a part of the stolen data in bid to force the company to meet the ransom demand. Hackers demanded $6,1 million in bitcoin and threatened to release all stolen data if demands werent fulfilled. A notable feature of Maze ransomware is that it sets the ransomware amount based on the type of device it detects. This is uncommon among other types of ransomware. Maze ransomware uses 2048 bit Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA) and the ChaCha20 stream cipher to encrypt individual files. It adds different extensions to the files during the encryption process. It then changes the user's desktop wallpaper to a message about the encrypted files and the file name of the dropped ransom note. In most cases, Maze is deployed onto the victim’s machine using a phishing email – increasingly common is a spear-phishing email – containing a malicious attachment, such as a macro-enabled Microsoft Word document or password-protected zip file. From examples seen in the wild, this document is often named something innocuous yet tempting, such as “Quarterly Report” or “Confidential Data Set.” Once it has been successfully deployed – that is, a user has opened the compromised document in the previous phishing example – it begins propagating within the user’s system. Simultaneously, it starts spreading laterally within the network, seeking ever-higher access privileges in order to do more damage. During this period, files start being encrypted, often affecting both the user’s local machine as well as cloud storage.\n\nIt is at this point that the ransomware payment demand usually appears, spelling out the attacker’s requirements and method of payment – usually with crypto-currency. Maze ransomware evades common security measures by starting off with a zip attachment that is encrypted with a password and\/or a document that includes a macro. This makes it very difficult for email security solutions to detect Maze ransomware. Next, the Maze ransomware scans the network for vulnerabilities. It looks for any weaknesses in network configuration, and across multiple Active Directory attributes. This way it gains critical insights and intelligence on the network itself and can embark on the next phase of its sinister mission. The Maze ransomware now begins moving laterally within the network. It does this initially by investigating the infected machine for clues regarding moving to the next machine and through the network, constantly scanning for passwords that are not well-protected. Should this prove unsuccessful, it moves on to other means such as brute-forcing access to new user accounts. Just moving laterally is not enough for attackers. They want to constantly be improving their level of access privileges to access more information and gain more control over the system. As increasingly elevated privileges are accessed, so the spread becomes easier and quicker.",

  "Attack Pattern": "USCG officials said they believe the point of entry was a malicious email sent to one of the maritime facility's employees. These emails are often sent from a spoofed address, so the sender name does not raise suspicion. A typical Ryuk attack begins when a user opens a weaponized Micrsoft Office document attached to a phishing email. Opening the document causes a malicious macro to execute a PowerShell command that attempts to download the banking Trojan Emotet. This Trojan has the ability to download additional malware onto an infected machine that retrieves and executes Trickbot, of which the main payload is spyware. This collects admin credentials, allowing attackers to move laterally to crivical assets connected to the network. The attack chian concludes when the attackers execute Ryuk on each of these assets. Once the network has been breached, the attackers decide whether they think it's worth the effort to further explore and infiltrate the network. If they have enough leverage to demand a large sum, then they will deploy the Ryuk ransomware. ",

  "Ransomware type": null,
  "Attack Pattern": "The first campaign, named 'xHunt', was carried out when criminals managed to install the Hisoka 0.8 malware to the internal network. The backdoor tools enabled the hackers to get unauthorized remote access to the PC and its data. The second attack was conducted in June and used the updated malware version called Hisoka 0.9 as well as Gon and EYE backdoor tools, that allowed cybercrimes to upload and download files, run commands and take screen recordings, scan for the open ports, get access to other systems on the corporate network and more.Hackers installed a backdoor tool named 'Hisoka'. Several custom tools (Sakabota, Netero, Killua) were later downloaded to the system in order to carry out post-exploitation activities. These tools not only use HTTP for their command and control (C2) channels, but certain variants of these tools use DNS tunneling for emails to communicatie with their C2 aswell. While DNS tunneling as a C2 channel is fairly common, the specific method in which this group used email to facilitate C2 communications has not been observed for a while. This method uses Exchange Web Services (EWS) and stolen credentials to create email 'drafts' to communicate between the actor and the tool. In addition to the aforementioned backdoor tools, tools referred to as Gon and EYE were also observed, which probide the backdoor access and the ability to carry out post-exploitation activities. During analysis, two different versions of Hisoka were identified, specifically vo.8 and v0.9. Both versions contain command sets that allow the actor to control a compromised system. In both versions, the actor can communicatie via a command and control (C2) channel that uses either HTTP or DNS tunneling. However, v0.9 also added the ability for an email-based C2 channel aswell. The email-based C2 communications capability added to Hisoka v0.9 relies on Exchange Web Services (EWS) to use a legitimate account on an Exchange server in order to allow the actor to communicatie with Hisoka. The malware attempts to log into an Exchange server using supplied credentials and uses EWS to send and recieve emails in order to establish communications between the target and the actor. However, the communications channel does not actually send and recieve emails like other email-based C2 channels seen in the past. Instead, the channel relies on creating email drafts that the Hisoka malware and the actor will process in order to exchange data back and forth. By using email drafts aswell as the same legitimate Exchange account to communicate, no emails will be detected outbound or recieved inbound. Researchers in June 2018 saw the file being transfered to another system on the network by the Server Message Block Protocol from an internal IT service desk account, and a short time later another file named 'Killua' was transfered the same way. Killua is a simple backdoor that allows an actor to issue commands from a C2 server to run on the infected system by communicating back and forth using DNS tunneling. ",

  "Attack Pattern": "Analyses pointed out that the AIS spoofing generator was located in the Elba Island area and that spoofing was conducted by a transmitter tuned onto AIS channel A, occupying around 54% of the available slots. The AIS messages currently lack a timestamp, which makes the AIS transmissions very vulnerable to replay attacks. In this type of attack, a malicious adversary can record a series of legitimate AIS transmissions from a vessel and replay them at any given time to create a fictitious target with real data. ",
  "Campaign": null,
  "Impact": "Thousands of AIS streams were received and recognized as Dutch-flagged naval. Deliberate spoofing of the vast number of artificial AIS targets temporarily affected the navigation of ships. A total of 870 different ships were shown at two different times  (13:13 and 13:28) with a duration of 3 min in the first transmission and 2 min in the second. All tracks appeared in an area of 28 × 21 nautical miles between the islands of Elba and Corsica with different routes and speeds, which made\nit impossible to monitor the maritime traffic in this area and\naffected the real ship transmissions. Research found 3,742 fake vessels (861 false tracks with MMSI 24480XXXX), which together generated 5,133 messages. ",

  "Additional info": " GNSS spoofing has been an issue in defence for many years and is now beginning to affect shipping. As more devices and autonomous systems rely on GNSS, even more systems may be vulnerable to spoofing attacks. The maritime industry and shipping are not immune to such cyber-attacks. There will be\nmany new cyber vulnerabilities in the future through which systems can be attacked if they are not  dequately protected. ",
  "Summary": "In December 2019, a spoofing incident occured near Elba, Italy, temporarily affecting the navigation system of 870+ vessels nearby. The affected vessels were spoofed and shown at incorrect time and location. Analyses pointed out that the AIS spoofing generator was located in the Elba Island area. Spoofing is increasingly becoming an issue in the maritime industry. ",

  "Additional info": "The Russian Federation used electronic warfare equipment almost 10,000 times to create false GPS signals that sent ships off-grid and hid the location of President Vladimir Putin.",
  "Summary": "In May 2018, Putin led a caravan of construction vehicles across the bridge from Russia to Crimea to celebrate the occasion. At the time of the incident, AIS records for vessels in the Kerch Strait show that vessel transit through the straight was severely restricted. During this period, at least 24 vessels anchored in waters near the bridge sent faked GNSS positional data to the Anapa Airport, which is over 65 kilometers distant. Vehicles thought to belong to the FSO drove alongside Putin's construction truck convoy as it crossed the Kerch Bridge on the same day. A line-of-sight analysis of a GNSS spoofing device's possible range suggests that a spoofing transmitter based on one of the FSO vehicles at the Kerch bridge would likely be capable of targeting all vessels that reported spoofed position information. AIS statistics show that this was the only sustained spoofing disruption in Kerch in 2018. GNSS spoofing events detected in Russia are likely designed to deceive GNSS receivers on commercial drones to activate firmware-level geofence locks that prevent these drones from flying in restricted airspace such as an airport.",

This activity appears to have been carefully pre-planned as the Yuk Tung and the Hika were unique in appearance: identical twin sister ships built in the\nsame year by the same manufacturer according to the same design specifications with the exact same profile, tonnage and equipment. The false registration papers and fake AIS transmissions, coupled with the physical deceptions employed by the vessel, provided the cover necessary to deceive any of the current, few due diligence and active compliance measures deployed by most global and regional commodity\ntraders.

When these credentials are stolen, threat actors can then intercept genuine business email exchanges, alter orders or financial details, and quietly reap the rewards. The threat actors use a wide range of tools after they have compromised accounts belonging to these companies. These include remote access software, keyloggers, and password stealers, many of which are available online publicly and with little investment. The threat actor utilizes tools including EmailPicky to scrape fresh victims from email contact lists, Predator Pain, PonyStealer, Agent Tesla, and HawkEye keyloggers. When it is time for payment details to be relayed to the buyer through an invoice, the threat actor intercepts the seller’s email and changes the destination bank account on the invoice to their money mule account. The attackers allegedly stole hundreds of thousands US dollars. They attempted to steal a minimum of $3.9 million U.S. dollars from maritime shipping businesses and their customers, while theft attempts average $6.7 million per year. The group behind this attack is called the Gold Galleon Group (Nigeria), consisting of 20 cybercriminals.",

The Zvezda Shipyard is located 30 kilometers from Vladivostok, near the remote Russian Far East town of Bolshoy Kamen. President Putin paid a visit to Bolshoy Kamen on his final day, on September 8, in Vladivostok for the 2017 Eastern Economic Forum to view the newly built Zvezda Shipyard. At 1:30 p.m. local time, the official Kremlin website reported on the visit and the Russian President's speech according to C4ADS. The only vessel anchored at the shipyard reported faked positional information at the Vladivostok International Airport at around 1:24 p.m. local time. This is the first and only time in 2017 that GNSS spoofing has been identified near Bolshoy Kamen. The fact that the GNSS spoofing discovered near the Zvezda Shipyard was only brief and isolated strongly suggests that the equipment used to cause these disruptions was based on a mobile platform and capable of creating restricted zones of spoofing.",

  "Summary": "In June 2017, at least 20 ships in the Black Sea near Novorossiysk Commercial Sea Port claimed that their Automatic Identification System incorrectly displayed their position as Gelendzhik Airport, about 32 kilometers inland. The large number of ships involved, as well as the fact that all the ships' tracking systems placed them in the same illogical location, prompted informed speculation, that the incident was caused by Russian testing of satellite navigation spoofing technology as part of its electronic warfare arsenal. It is reported that the incidents happened in order to protect Putin and to obfuscate his movements. It was also to protect secretive Russian areas.",

  "Summary": "In the period between 2015 and 2016, a longliner fishing vessel called 'Corinthian Bay' goes dark in Heard Island & McDonalds Islands in Australia. The vessel got dark by disengaging it's tracking system near a protected Marine Reserve on 10 separate occasions over one year. By doing this, the vessel could conduct illegal activities like fishing in no-take protected areas or entering another country’s waters without authorisation.",

  "Summary": "In May 2013, mulptiple shipping and logistics companies and a manufacturer got hit by a Zombie Zero malware attack. Zombie Zero is highly unusual in that the entry point is based on malware that has been “weaponized” through its placement within hardware developed by an original manufacturer, then sold to unsuspecting customers. The Zombie Zero malware was preloaded into newly manufactured scanners by a manufacturer in China. Once the scanners were installed and in use, the secretly embedded malware had instant access inside the perimeter protections. The scanners had been distributed to seven shipping and logistics companies and one manufacturer, for use in checking items being shipped. As a result, the attack compromised all aspects of corporate transactions, such as financial data, customer data, detailed shipping and manifest information.",

  "Summary": "In April 2012, hackers from a foreign state made their way to the Danish Maritime Authority IT systems in search of confidential information. The hacks targeted sensitive information on Danish shipping companies and the merchant navy. The hackers probably managed to gain access to the Danish Maritime Authority IT systems by hiding a virus in a PDF document attached to an email sent to an employee of the Agency. When the employee opened the infected PDF file, hackers were given back-door access to the contents of his computer and the rest of the Maritime Authority’s network. They got access to an additional 13 PCs and a number of servers. From there, they were able to access the Business Ministry’s IT system. As a result of the hack, there was a disclosure of sensitive information. China is seen as the likely culprit, but the Chinese Embassy in Copenhagen denied that Chinese authorities had any knowledge of the hack.",
